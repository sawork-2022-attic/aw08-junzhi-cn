这样做的好处在于，通过消息驱动的应用，可以降低不同模块之间的耦合度，让系统更专注于单纯的接受和处理与发送，而不用关注其他系统内的具体实现等。这样可以大大增加模块的独立性，有利于模块化开发。

    "id": "kswv7NIaTCaIIErlBzODaA",
    "url": "https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/kswv7NIaTCaIIErlBzODaA",
    "value": "Chuck Norris's shadow weighs 250 pounds and can kick your ass ."
}
```

Try to understand the provided code which demonstrates spring integration between a spring boot application with an externel http service (https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random).

Please implement delivery as an standalone service (just like the random joke service). Refer the sample code to integrate your Micropos system with delivery service so that user can check delivery status on Miropos which actually forwards user request to delivery service on demand.
